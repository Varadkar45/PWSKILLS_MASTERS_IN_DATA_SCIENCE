    "## 6. Name a few blocks of code used to define In Python language? \n",
    "**Ans.** In Python, there are several blocks of code that are used to define different structures, including:\n",
    "1) Functions: Functions are blocks of code that perform a specific task and can be called multiple times in a program. They are defined using the \"def\" keyword, followed by the function name and the function parameters in parentheses.\n",
    "2) Classes: Classes are blocks of code that define objects and their behaviors. They are defined using the \"class\" keyword, followed by the class name and a colon.\n",
    "3) Loops: Loops are blocks of code that repeat a set of instructions for a specified number of times or until a certain condition is met. There are two main types of loops in Python: \"for\" loops and \"while\" loops.\n",
    "4) Conditional statements: Conditional statements are blocks of code that execute a set of instructions based on a condition. The two main types of conditional statements in Python are \"if\" statements and \"if-else\" statements.\n",
    "5) Try-except blocks: Try-except blocks are blocks of code used to handle exceptions (errors) that may occur during the execution of a program. The \"try\" block contains the code that may raise an exception, and the \"except\" block contains the code that will be executed if an exception occurs."

The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager. The Python memory manager has different components which deal with various dynamic storage management aspects, like sharing, segmentation, preallocation or caching."
